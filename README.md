# Plant Watering Device with HTML server Capabilities

Another simple device which was made to test capabilities of NodeMCU ESP8266, and displaying informations on HTML Server through WI-Fi.

So to start simply. I wanted to monitor the condition of plants in my house and to make myself sure that they won't die if I forget to water them everyday.
I used some soil Humidity sensors to measure the ground and water level sensors to measure how much water is left in the water bottle which was supplying water to the pumps. 

This project was not meant to be professional. It was just a test of NodeMcu ESP8266 and it's capabilities to create a remote Wi-Fi monitor.
